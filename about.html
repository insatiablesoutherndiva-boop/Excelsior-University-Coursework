      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Veteran Resume and Job Services was founded with one mission: to help veterans and their families 
        successfully transition into civilian careers. We understand the challenges of translating military 
        skills into terms that civilian recruiters and hiring managers recognize.

      <p>
        My name is Jordan Taylor, and I am passionate about helping veterans succeed after service. 
        As a veteran myself, I know firsthand the challenges of navigating the civilian job market. 
        My career has been dedicated to bridging the gap between military experience and professional 
        opportunities. I take pride in guiding service members through resume development, interview 
        preparation, and long-term career planning. This work is more than a jobâ€”it is my commitment 
        to ensuring that every veteran has the tools to thrive in the next chapter of their career.
